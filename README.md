- 👋 Hi, I’m a Richard White, and i live in Russia.
- 👀 I’m interested in creating programms (or some malwares... maybe)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, and i made 2 programms that are not on GitHub for now (but looking forward to publishing)
- 🎮 I like GAMING like you. My favorite game is Minecraft, but i like other games like Roblox, Geometry Dash, Just Shapes & Beats, Project Arrhythmia, etc too.
- 📚 Started my code learning from Windows Batch scripting. Then I started learning C# with the help of the teacher, but then I started learning on my own... when I suddenly got known that there's an AI for helping with the code and its free-ish.
- 🖥️ I had a low-end computer with old AMD proccesor that can barely run Windows 10 (rip). I've got an upgrade with AMD proccesor TOO (not that old) because I needed to learn a lot.
